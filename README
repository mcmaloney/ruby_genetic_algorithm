What It Does:

This is a very basic genetic algorithm. You provide the program with a target string, then have it generate its own training data randomly with characters from the same family as the target. (Example- here I'm using the family of ASCII characters from SPACE to lower-case z.)

Once it has its random data set, it then evolves toward the target through fitness-based selection, mating and mutation. The fitness score given to each Citizen object (in the Population) is just a way to determine how much like the target it is. A low or near-zero fitness score means that the Citizen object is more like the target than one with a higher score. As you watch the population evolve, the fitness score of the best Citizen of one generation will get smaller until it actually reaches zero, or hits the target.


Usage:

In this directory:

irb
require 'ga_run'
start_it
loop_it

'start_it' outputs the entire initial population. Don't worry. Just clear your screen and loop_it.

Messing With It:

- The Target value (a string, in this case) is specified at the top of ga.rb. Change this to your name or the name of a pet; enjoy convergence.

- I have a really shitty mutation rate thingey in here because I was really interested in making this work, not optimizing it just yet. 

- Yadda yadda- you see what I'm getting at. Change the constants in ga.rb and different stuff will happen.
